ESPRESSO
========
by Jens Dahl Møllerhøj

# What is espresso?
A lightning fast game development engine. It is used to build tiny html5
canvas games in minutes.

# What is the idea?
Useing coffeescript with a API that resamples the way Game Maker by Mark
Overmars works.

# Why is it faster to build games with Espresso?
The Cakefile generates a AppData classes that the application uses to load
sprites and entities from predefined folders. The entites step and draw
methods are automatically called, and can use the espresso API

# Is espresso ready to use?
Espresso is useable, but not very stable. The current release is really early.
I've only spend about a week working on it.

# What needs to be done?
The level editor shall be presented more nice, a documentation for the use of
the API and general accessability. Current tasks that is being worked on it in
the TODO.txt file
