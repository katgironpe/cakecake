copy from
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/onslaught/

Path finding

Platform engine clean up

__IDEAS AND THOUGHTS__

Make a seperate class for camera? Split up the Art class a bit?
Entity = UI.
No such thing as a UI element. 
Mouse collision moved to Collision object.
Standard UI objects to a standard library.


__LEVEL_EDITOR___
The Level editor must not be affected by zoomlevel, and should therefore be
vector graphics.

Switching levels
Placing objects with preset variables
Undo / Redo
Menu with scrollbar
Grid size setting
Grid work with zooming

Move objects

Buttons:
Show/Hide menu
Snap to grid
Move camera
Jump to 0,0
Create entity
Remove entity
Zoom in
Zoom out

___EXPORT_GAMES__

Minimalize js.
create the website dynmaticly from games and description+ introduction files.

__ERROR__MESSAGES__
error system
image file not fould
index not found

___CANVAS_COMPOSITE___
Checkout clip() method. Useful?
Canvas composite:
Make a buffer canvas. Only 5 works cross browser:

_________________WAIT______________
animation: Know index_max
w Camera: Rotation, Have Art offset and scale values? Lower coupling?
w Screens + UI Menu
w Create canvas in seperate class instead of world
w coffeescript getters and setters
w menus and screens
w entity value that makes object follow screen? (Maybe remove the drawC
    methods from Art?)
w Ui Menu element
w Ui elements loaded correctly
w UI objects.. How should they work? (remove the step function?)
w x and y offset to the center?
w define meaningful list and array functions (like copy)
w splice Art in typogray and art?
w documentation
w Brass monkey

Mysterious 'nd' or 'd' in AppData file appears random
___________________DONE______________
sign
alpha
look at making code more clean
toggle
entities has a type variable that can be used with collisions
Zooming
no sprite object: send entity as sprite
anitmation
Reset game? Start load and end game? Screens? Rooms?
Load levels from seperate file
folders for unused images and entities
Art offset. Should mouse position be considered?
leveleditor drag objes
leveleditor snap to grid
