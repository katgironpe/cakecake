Testable code needed!
All folders should be able to have subpaths:
Template folder could have some template file examples.

espresso path:
test/
  test_*
app/
  Art.. split to:
    Text (public methods for drawing)
    Image (public methods for showing images)
            privately load all the images
    Vector (public methods for vector drawing)
  Collision (public methods for calc collision)
  Entity (Base class)
  Game + start -> Rename: engine (Engine)
  World -> extends entity and can have children. has a load method, that loads a .lvl file, and builts a level inside of it
  Current worldclass must be split into: engine, entity and a level manager
  Level (public methods to switch and create levels)
  Keyboard (Keyboard handling)
  Utils (Minor extensions and helper methods)
  appdata.tmp <- list resources + name of app
scripts/
  espresso scripts:
    espresso create entity player
    espresso create level lvl0
    espresso new myapp
    espresso build -> cake build with dev=true
    espresso export -> cake build with dev=false
    espresso help
dev/
  vector editor
  flow level editor
  grid level editor
  sprite editor
  sound editor
template/
  .espresso <- this is an espresso app (file)
  settings <- setable
  sounds
  sprites/
  vectors/ (math+graphics?)
  fonts/
    espresso.font
  entities/
  levels/
  ui/ (maybe)
  output/
    warning.txt (this is a compile-to folder)
    index (with level editor)
    (game.js) (compiled, dev flag)
    css (with level editor)
  export/
    warning.txt (this is a compile-to folder)
    index
    (game.js) (compiled, dev flag)
    css
