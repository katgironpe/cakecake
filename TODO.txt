- All folders should be able to have subpaths
- watch for changes
- RoR website to push games to.
- GameController seperation
- Secure inherit of entities
- Art remove?
- Text include variables
- Pause reset entity positions

Fix the set_x, set_y, set_width etc of entity
Make a default font
Make draw functions functional?
Cakefile split

facts:
  Physics require a global world class!

  world -> entity -> drawable: bad idea?

  drawables: no need to initialize

  button: entity, contained by another entity!

  font: define and reuse?

IDEA:
drawable: parent for text, sprite, button?

--- !!!! entities: have a collection of drawables?

lines = []

for i in a

for i in a
  draw line x1y1 -> x2y2

entity -> 
  @line.draw(d)
  @rectangle.draw(d)
  @text.draw(d)
  @sprite.draw(d)

  entities
  body
  knows world

'holds entities'            'holds entities and drawables'    'nothing'
world <------------------> entity (extends drawable) --> drawables

entity -> ask for spawn 
          ask world questions
          ask physics questions
          ask art to draw

'root of entities'
world -> 
         answer questions about all entities
         safe remove entities
         spawn entities (using factory)

         holds physics


         (step entities)

         #remove:
         draw background
         draw physics

director <------> rule

ruler (extends entity?) -> knows director.

director ->
         create (global rule)
         create rule
         create world
         level change/load etc
         load level. (by using loader)

entityfactory ->
        spawn entity

art ->
  static draw
